                    <p class="card-text">
                        Angular Signals is the main feature developers have been waiting for since the Angular 16
                        roadmap
                        was
                        released. Although Solid.js inspired this concept, it is a whole new concept for Angular. It
                        allows
                        you
                        to define reactive values and express dependencies between them. In other words, you can
                        efficiently
                        use
                        Angular signals to manage state changes within Angular applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A signal can be recognized as a regular variable that users can synchronously access. But it
                        comes
                        with
                        some additional features like notifying others (component templates, other signals, functions,
                        etc.)
                        of
                        its value changes and creating a derived state in a declarative way.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">2. Server-Side Rendering</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The lack of server-side rendering (SSR) support was one of the most significant drawbacks of
                        Angular
                        compared to React. Angular 16 has resolved this issue with some significant improvements for
                        server-side
                        rendering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before, Angular used destructive hydration for SSR. In destructive hydration, the server first
                        renders
                        and loads the application to the browser. Then, when the client app gets downloaded and
                        bootstrapped, it
                        destroys the already rendered DOM and re-renders the client app from scratch. This approach
                        caused
                        significant UX issues, like screen flickering, and negatively impacted some Core Web Vitals such
                        as
                        LCP
                        or CLS.anug.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Angular 16 introduces a new approach called non-destructive hydration to prevent these
                        drawbacks.
                        The
                        DOM is not destroyed when the client app is downloaded and bootstrapped. It uses the same DOM
                        while
                        enriching it with client-side features like event listeners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Non-destructive hydration is still at the developer preview stage. But you can enable it by
                        adding
                        provideClientHydration() as a provider when bootstrapping the application.

                        Jest is one of the most-used testing frameworks among JavaScript developers. Angular has
                        listened to
                        developer requests and has introduced experimental Jest support with Angular 16.

                    <p>
                        All you have to do is install Jest using npm and update the angular.json file.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Angular 16 introduces an esbuild-based build system for the development server (ng serve). Vite
                        powers
                        this new development server and uses esbuild to build artifacts.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is still at the developer preview stage, but you can enable it by updating the angular.json
                        file
                        with the following.

                    </p>

                <code [innerHTML]="esbuildCode"></code>

                    <p class="card-text">

                        In Angular 16, you can now define input values as required. You can either use the
                        <span class="code">Input</span> decorator or the <span class="code"> Component </span>
                        decorator inputs array to define one.
                    </p>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>

                    <p class="card-text">


                        Angular 16 allows you to bind route parameters into component inputs, removing the need to
                        inject ActivatedRoute into the components. To enable this feature, you must import RouterModule
                        and enable the bindToComponentInputs property in the app.module.ts file.
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        <code [innerHTML]="spsCode"></code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>The following example shows how we can bind query params to component inputs.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code [innerHTML]="spsCode"></code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Now, when you navigate to the articles route, you can pass query params using the name of the
                        component input. In this case, an example URL will look like the following.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code [innerHTML]="spsCode"></code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>If the input name is too long, you can rename the query parameter.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code [innerHTML]="spsCode"></code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>You can also use this approach to bind path parameters and route data.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Angular 14 started supporting standalone components, which are independent of modules. Angular
                        16 takes this to the next level by supporting standalone project creation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Angular 16 has a flag to create a standalone project through the Angular CLI. You have to
                        execute ng new command with the â€“standalone flag. Then, it will generate a project without
                        NgModules.
